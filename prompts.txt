Bro, I am not using the file upload in the product adding. Instead I am getting it as a formData like req.body.images. And converting this by saveBase64Image function. And also I am adding the filename to the data that is going to save to the database. So implement this functionality in the coupon section for only one image. 

You can also refer the add_product.ejs to know how I am handling the data there including the image.
I think I am sending the data of the fields through the form itself. So if you can do the same method in the coupons.ejs and in it's controller, then that's better.
So after knowing it correctly and making sure it will work then do the changes.
